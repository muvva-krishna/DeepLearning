# 🍷 Neural Network from Scratch – Wine Dataset Classification

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **feedforward neural network** from scratch using **NumPy** only, designed for **multi-class classification** on the Wine dataset. The model is built without any high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, providing complete control over the learning process and internal workings.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 13 features (from the Wine dataset)  
- **Hidden Layer**: 1 hidden layer with 16 neurons and **ReLU** activation  
- **Output Layer**: 6 output classes with **Softmax** activation
